# Computer-Graphics-and-Ray-Tracing
This ray tracing renderer is a C-based project designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts of ray tracing by rendering simple 2D scenes. It primarily focuses on rendering basic geometric shapes such as circles and squares, employing core ray tracing techniques to compute the intersections of rays with these objects to determine visible surfaces.

To compile and run the renderer, use the following commands:

make clean

make

make hottest

make rendertest

./bin/hittest

./bin/rendertest

feh ppm/testRenderSimpleNonLightedScene.ppm
